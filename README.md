# UFarm

There are four types of users to this project. The Agricultural officer (to be considered as the super admin), the farmerone, the urban famer and finally the users.
Only the farmers need to be registered (accounts created)

The farmerones are the equivalent of department heads, the agricultural officer registers the farmerones and they in turn register the urban farmers.

Only registered urban farmers can upload products to be displayed in the market place.
